Things I'd like to do at some point:
* support RCS translation, for really fine TCMs
* add new mj_modes that live-update values for Fixed
  - Srf Prograde
  - AoA Hold
* make target_body runtime-settable, like body_id is
* use 3d sim for asc & retro.  Having RelInc (asc) or accurate touchdown point
  (retro) would be really helpful.

Next major target is to support interplanetary astrogation.  For that we will
require a few things:
* solve for closest approach (we can't just aim for Ap like we did with lunar)
  - probably binary search
* support for non-full-length burns (needed for TCMs)
  - this is now done, but sub-items below aren't yet
  - maybe also burns that aren't an integer number of seconds long
  - this could be on a separate TCM console that's only used once in
    heliocentric orbit, thus avoiding dealing with patching
  - but we then might want to be able to patch into the target SOI, and find our
    subsequent periapsis
* support RCS translation, for really fine TCMs


Other things I'd like to do at some point:
* add new mj_modes that live-update values for Fixed
  - Srf Prograde
  - AoA Hold
* make target_body runtime-settable, like body_id is
* use 3d sim for asc & retro.  Having RelInc (asc) or accurate touchdown point
  (retro) would be really helpful.

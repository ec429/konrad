KONRAD - Kerbal Operations, Naughty Rockets, Aerial Debris

A telemachus control panel with a retro feel.  Built on curses technology.

Consoles
--------
konrad.py must always be run with a 'consname' argument, indicating which
console it should display.  So far we have the following:
* fd
	Flight Director.  Summarises key vehicle state.
* traj
	Trajectory.  The guy who's steering probably wants this one.

Useful Notes
------------
There are two kinds of FractionGauge: Mode 3 and Mode 2.  (Naturally.)
Mode 3 gauges simply fill up from left to right, mostly green, with red and
yellow denoting a 1/3 and 2/3 filled block respectively.  They are used either
where an overshoot is physically impossible (e.g. >100% fuel reserve) or for
angle gauges, where the values wrap around (and may become negative; these
gauges will use the absolute value in this situation).
Mode 2 gauges are used when there is an (implicit or explicit) target for the
value being displayed (e.g. altitude, apsides or velocity).  These gauges also
fill up with green, with yellow denoting a 1/2 block.  However, once they
overshoot the target, they 'bounce off' the end in red.  So a bar 3/4 green and
the rest red indicates a value 125% of the target.

Because Telemachus won't give us the bodyID (only its name), KONRAD has to be
told it by the user (-b option, defaults to 1).  If the current body name does
not match the name retrieved for the bodyID, KONRAD will warn the user, showing
a value of <current>!<expected> in the BodyGauge (and pushing a "Change Body"
message to the status line).  In this situation, calculated values such as the
target orbital velocity will be bogus.
